# Expert_System

An expert system has for a goal to emulate the descision making abilites of a human expert. In this project, we aimed to build
our own expert system that deducts queries given a set of rules and facts.

Using backwards chaining we find solutions by breaking down the rules for our goals into pieces and looking for the answer to thoses pieces,
then we bring it back together. This results in a comprehensive and efficent aproach to find all the desired values.
